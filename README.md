# BetterDiscordPlugins
This is where I store the plugins I make for BetterDiscord.

# [Auto Idle](https://github.com/GentlePuppet/BetterDiscordPlugins/blob/main/AutoIdle)
> AutoIdle is a simple plugin that automatically changes your status based on your Discord activity.

# [Full Res Avatar Hover](https://github.com/GentlePuppet/BetterDiscordPlugins/blob/main/FullResAvatarHover) 
> A simple BetterDiscord plugin that lets you hover over user avatars to see a higher-resolution version in a floating panel.

# [Loop Videos](https://github.com/GentlePuppet/BetterDiscordPlugins/blob/main/Loop%20Videos)
> A super simple BetterDiscord plugin that makes that any video you watch automatically loop, instead of ending.
