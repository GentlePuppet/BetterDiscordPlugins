## Overview

**AutoIdle** is a simple plugin I made to replace a complex outdate one I use to use.
This plugin automatically manages your Discord status by switching between chosen statuses based on your Discord activity:

- When you are actively using Discord (window focused), your status is set to **(Default: Online)** after a configurable delay (Default: 5s).
- When you switch away from Discord (window unfocused), your status changes to **(Default: Idle)** after a configurable delay (Default: 5s).
- If you are in a voice call, your status will **not** be changed automatically, so your status reflects your call presence.
- The plugin respects manual **Do Not Disturb (DND)** and **Invisible** statuses, leaving them unchanged unless configured otherwise.

- Switch your status to your chosen **active status** (default: Online) when Discord gains focus.
- Switch your status to your chosen **away status** (default: Idle) when Discord loses focus.

Adjust the behavior using the plugin’s settings panel to suit your preferences.
